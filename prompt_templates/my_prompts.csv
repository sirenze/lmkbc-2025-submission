Relation,PromptTemplate
hasArea,"State the geographical area of {subject} in square kilometres, without printing the unit. Locate it geographically, identify the kind of geographical feature or entity it is, and then find its area. Your sources could be wikipedia, encyclopedias, physical maps, guidebooks and so on. If you are unsure, (1) think about similar subjects and their area, or (2) features nearby {subject} to help you find the area which is the object. \n Three things to note: \n 1. The area is in square kilometres, so if the area you find is in a different unit, convert it to square kilometres before giving it to me, but do not print the unit. \n 2. If for some reason you have conflicting information, say for example, two or more sources that give you different areas, then use the most reliable source you have. \n 3. If you have multiple subjects with the same name, then provide the area for the most well-known subject with that name. \n\n Here you go! Subject: {subject}, Relation: {relation}, Object: ?"
hasCapacity,"Give me the capacity of {subject} in number of people, but do not print the unit. If you are not sure about the exact capacity, provide the best estimate you can by thinking of similar subjects across the world, or other subjects in the same geography. Consider the {subject}, its geographical location and its capacity. If you can find sources like wikipedia or news articles that list the capacity of {subject}, those would be your best bet. You could also identify the purpose that {subject} is used for, and find its capacity by taking into account similar structures and the geography that {subject} is located in. \n\n Here you go! Subject: {subject}, Relation: {relation}, Object: ?"
countryLandBordersCountry,"List the countries that share a land border with {subject}. Consider {subject}, locate it geographically, continent-wise and on a map - then find its neighbours. \n As an intermediate step, you can try filling in the blanks: \"{subject} is located in _, and its neighbours are _\". \n\n And you can fill in the following blanks as well: \n Northern border of {subject} is with _, Northeastern border of {subject} is with _, Eastern border of {subject} is with _, Southeastern border of {subject} is with _, Southern border of {subject} is with _, Southwestern border of {subject} is with _, Western border of {subject} is with _, and Northwestern border of {subject} is with _. \n\ This way, you can gather your answers and then list the countries that share a land border with {subject}. \n\n You can think about and find sources like encyclopedias, reports, or maps that talk about the land borders of {subject}. Countries can be islands and enclaves too, so be very astute in your search. \n\n Here you go! Subject: {subject}, Relation: {relation}, Object: ?"
personHasCityOfDeath,"In the case of this relation - {relation}, you should list the city where {subject} died. Only the city, not its larger location. Consider this person, their life, their work, and the place where they died. If you are sure that {subject} died in a specific city, list that city. But this {subject} could very well be alive, or the city of death unknown to you - in both these cases, you should be returning \"None\". Verify your answers before you give me the final answers. There is no thinking required on your side in this case, either this person has died and you have sources that say so in which case you will give me an answer - else they have not died. Do not guess! \n\n Here you go! Subject: {subject}, Relation: {relation}, Object: ?"
awardWonBy,"Here, you should list the names of the objects(awardees/winners) who have won the {subject} award/honor. The awardees of {subject} could be persons, specific entities (like album names or band names in the case of music, or entire teams from countries in the case of team sports for example) or organisations. Consider the {subject}, the field in which it is given, and its periodicity (for instance, awarded early or not). \n\n List as many awardees as you know, or try to provide a list of famous recipients at least. Do not repeat the objects/awardees though. \n\n {subject} is an award/honor that exists, so try and match the award exactly â€“ not to something similar, but that exact award. Try to find sources like news or reports that talk about these awards and awardees. \n\n List years and awardees as an intermediate step so as to keep track, and them combine it all together. And remember, even if a person received it multiple times, I want them listed only once. Having no repetitions is key. \n\n Here you go! Subject: {subject}, Relation: {relation}, Object: ?"
companyTradesAtStockExchange,"Here, list the stock exchanges where {subject} trades at present. Remember, objects are stock exchanges and stock exchanges alone. Consider the company, its headquarters and locations, the indices it is part of and the stock exchanges it is listed at. \n If you can find, and are sure that {subject} trades at specific stock exchanges, list those stock exchanges. \n It could be that {subject} trades at stock exchanges in geographies other than where it is headquartered, so do not limit yourself to just one geography. \n And in the same country too, there could be multiple stock exchanges where the {subject} is listed at. Remember, a company may trade at multiple stock exchanges across geographies, so apart from annual company reports and the like, you can use financial news and reports to find your answers. \n\n No guessing - I want you to try and verify your answers by finding the relevant stock ticker/code at the related stock exchange as well (because one ticker/code per exchange), but do not list the tickers/codes, only the name of the stock exchanges. If you are not sure about the stock exchange, or if you are sure the company is not listed at all, return \"None\". \n\n Here you go! Subject: {subject}, Relation: {relation}, Object: ?"
